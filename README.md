# Cook and Count 🍲📱

**Cook and Count** is a smart Android-based mobile application that assists users during pressure cooking by automatically detecting and counting real pressure cooker whistles using sound input. The app notifies the user when the desired whistle count is reached, helping to avoid overcooking or undercooking — especially in traditional Indian cooking.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In many Indian households, cooking time is estimated based on pressure cooker whistles (e.g., 2 whistles for rice, 4 for dal). Our app simplifies this by automatically detecting the whistles using the phone’s microphone and providing alerts when the set target is reached.

This repository contains:
- A Figma-based prototype of the app
- Java-based working model (in progress)
- Documentation of the idea and features
