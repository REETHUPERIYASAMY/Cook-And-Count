# Problem Statement

In Indian kitchens, pressure cookers are widely used, and the number of whistles is often used as a traditional way to track cooking time. However, counting whistles manually can be difficult when someone is multitasking, busy, or not near the kitchen. Missing even one whistle can lead to overcooked or undercooked food.

We personally faced this problem in our day-to-day lives — especially when juggling other tasks while cooking. This made us realize the need for a smarter, more reliable way to track whistle counts without constantly staying alert near the stove.

Currently, available apps mostly rely on timers or manual inputs, without detecting real whistle sounds. They also lack additional features like chef guidance or smart alerts based on actual audio input.

Our project, **Cook and Count**, is a smart mobile application that:

- Detects real pressure cooker whistles using the phone's microphone
- Notifies the user when the set number of whistles is reached
- Offers preset whistle counts for common dishes like rice, dal, and vegetables
- Provides a simple and accessible user interface suitable for all age groups

This solution makes everyday cooking easier, safer, and more accurate — especially for beginners, elderly users, and anyone who wants a more relaxed kitchen experience.
